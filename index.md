## Introduction 
Hello and welcome to my notebook. It's technically a blog but I chose the gitbook style in the hope that this would be a public notebook. 

You can find the github repo to the Jekyll theme [here](https://github.com/sighingnow/jekyll-gitbook).

Some pages might be very long, and I would recommend using the table of contents on the side bar.

## About the Creator

*I still don't know how to properly introduce myself, so in general please just take me as a normal human being.*

I am a second-year computer science student (with limited coding experience... but I'm working on it) and I do love math as every Chinese does (not really, I'm the only one in my friend group). I'm a beginner in German and have native fluency in mandarin, so you would see three languages on this webiste and I would not apologize for that. Most content would be in English.

I am an RA in [AidData](aiddata.org) and a volunteer who offers technical (and emotional) support in the [Bray School](https://brayschool.pages.wm.edu/). As a collaborative community research project with my long-lost American sister Kaleea Korunka, I'm working on [scraping eviction data](https://github.com/yxlol/Virginia-Eviction) from online court records using Selenium. The reason I'm doing such a fun project is because I participated in Sharpe scholar program last year, and for whatever reason I also attended the bonus mapping project, where I created [this story map on Shanghai Lockdown in 2022](https://arcg.is/1TG0Le). My Github page where you can see what I'm working on is [here](https://github.com/yxlol). 

In my free time I read about China and other random topics and watch documentaries. I love biking around if it's safe and the weather is nice. I also have many penpals which I would probably reference to a lot. Most of the hobbies (besides biking) I have now were started during my gap year in 2020-2021. 

You are more than welcome to ask me math questions, but keep in mind I am not actually an expert on it, contrary to what you think. (just kidding, but feel free to ask.)

## Big Picture

My primary goal is to use this site to organize the notes and resources that I find potentially significant enough to share. For convenience this site would include some class materials for Chinese 101 TA sessions. 

I might also include the personal programming projects, but that wouldn't be the primary usage of the site.

## Copyrights and Privacy
Feel free to contact me if you are not certain. In general, as part of the CC BY-SA 4.0 liscense, you can share and use the materials as long as it's not for commercial use, and I would not be responsible for any consequences resulted from using them.

I *do not* include any trackers or analytic tools on this website, though these can be easily integrated with the theme I use. I've removed all codes and files that I've found relevant to this function. However, I'm not sure about the third-party embeded sources (pictures, music, videos) etc. 

## Final Thoughts

Thanks for bearing with me. If you are interested in contributing to the site/any random projects I'm working on, you can find my contact information [here](https://yxlol.github.io/yx/pages/contact/). Any comments and suggestions for resources are welcome, and while I'm really not the best person to answer anything, feel free to drop questions. 

I think I would in general need to include a content warning for the site materials, because of the nature of the topic we are dealing with. Many people ask me when would all of these end, and while I have no clue as everybody else, I bluntly believe that there is some hope in the future, though I don't know if we would be able to see it, and if that's the kind of hope we want. 

With that, I hope you have a great day.
