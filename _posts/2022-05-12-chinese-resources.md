## Pronounciation

- [Pinyin Chart](https://yoyochinese.com/chinese-learning-tools/Mandarin-Chinese-pronunciation-lesson/pinyin-chart-table)
   - My penpal from Brazil shared it with me. 
   - I think it is a good resource for starters to get used to the pronounciation of the language, especially because it includes all the tones.

## Media

*From my very limited expeirence of learning English, using the language to do things that are interesting and learning about the context is very helpful to keep up the motivation. After all it is a language not a formula, so we should enjoy our lives with the skill. I am on the consumer side of the information I listed below, and I receive no profits if you read them or not, so it's truly just a suggestion.*

- 长毛象 [m.cmx.im](m.cmx.im) , 活吧 [alive.bar](alive.bar)
   - Mastodon Instance with mostly simplified Chinese. 
   - [What is mastodon?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software))
   - Since *all* social media available in mainland China now would require a Chinese phone number to register, you might be interested in the alternative platforms...
 - [知乎](zhihu.com), while you cannot register without a phone number, if you google random things in Chinese and add site:.zhihu.com, sometimes it can generate interesting results.
 - [豆瓣](douban.com), Chinese version of goodreads + imdb + reddit + etc. If you are curious about Chinese films/literature (or Chinese' reactions to any films) you can use site:.douban.com
