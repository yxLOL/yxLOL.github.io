## Pronounciation

- [Pinyin Chart](https://yoyochinese.com/chinese-learning-tools/Mandarin-Chinese-pronunciation-lesson/pinyin-chart-table)
   - My penpal from Brazil shared it with me. 
   - I think it is a good resource for starters to get used to the pronounciation of the language, especially because it includes all the tones. 

## Vocabulary
- [Essential Chinese for English Speakers Anki Deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1322310186)
  - A recommendation by a friend who learned Chinese extensively (then quitted recently to focus on Japanese)
  - According to him, expanding vocab by learning the Pinyin & pronounciation first paired with English meanings would be helpful in expanding things you can say and keep up the motivation. It also provides the characters for those of you who still want to be literate.
  - Have fun (?)
  - I learned English vocab, chemistry and econ definitions with anki (an open source software) for a while in high school, and I can confirm it might be useful. You can choose to memorize pronounciation and its definition, but of course you can always memorize the characters included in it too. It even has visuals and pronounciations that are not always produced by robots (so, more close to how I would pronounce them). (you can download anki [here](https://apps.ankiweb.net/))

## Recommended Texts

- This website consists of a lot of Chinese textbooks free to [download](http://www.hwjyw.com/textbooks/). They follow a similar format as the ones I used in primary school. The original intention is for the weekend schools for Chinese descendents to learn the language, and thus there is very limited English text on the book. Not sure if that's the best part about them, but I think it might be helpful, especially for beginners. (found it with an [AidData project](https://china.aiddata.org/projects/65888/))

## Media

*From my very limited expeirence of learning English, using the language to do things that are interesting and learning about the context is very helpful to keep up the motivation. After all it is a language not a formula, so we should enjoy our lives with the skill. I am on the consumer side of the information I listed below, and I receive no profits if you read them or not, so it's truly just a suggestion.*

*And yes, 80% of the English sources are things I encountered by recommendation of Professor Hill in his China Debate seminar.*

- 长毛象 [m.cmx.im](m.cmx.im) , 活吧 [alive.bar](alive.bar)
   - Mastodon Instance with mostly simplified Chinese. 
   - [What is mastodon?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software))
   - Since *all* social media available in mainland China now would require a Chinese phone number to register, you might be interested in the alternative platforms...
 - [知乎](zhihu.com), while you cannot register without a phone number, if you google random things in Chinese and add site:.zhihu.com, sometimes it can generate interesting results.
 - [豆瓣](douban.com), Chinese version of goodreads + imdb + reddit + etc. If you are curious about Chinese films/literature (or Chinese' reactions to any films) you can use site:.douban.com
- Youtube Channels
   - [美食作家王刚](https://youtu.be/EhyQom5jiTE) This one (with English Sub) shows how to shred potatoes. His channel has always been my guilty pleasure... Very useless, but that's because I'm not good enough to learn how to cook properly.
