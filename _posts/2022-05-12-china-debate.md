## Involution

### Deliver Driver, Stuck in the System by Lai Youxuan

Renwu Magazine: 
Start in 80s
Non-fiction stories

*System*

> "Our slogan is ‘Meituan delivers everything fast 美团外卖，送啥都快' , and the average arrival time is 28 minutes.It's a great technological achievement."

> "Speeding, running red lights, driving against traffic... these drivers' decisions to contravene traffic regulations constitute an ‘inverse algorithm, ’ which is a necessary labor practice created by the drivers who have been under the control and discipline of the system algorithm for a long time."

> "Drivers can never fight system delivery times on their own, all we can do is exceed the speed limit to make up for it."

> “System tells another two minutes you to take an overpass

> All it takes is a heavy rain to shatter this "optimality. "

> Different food preperation time, fixed"delivery time"

> Waiting for the elevator is a real pain for us. You have no idea. "

*Safety education video &"Say cheese"*

> Their scooter typically maxed out at around 40 kilometers per hour, well above the new speed limit.

**Involution**
> “His income went down, especially after the pandemic, when more and more people took up delivery service, and sometimes there were no orders at all.”

> “Among those signing up, factory workers ranked first, followed by retail workers.”

> They decided to be a delivery driver mostly because money. Many of them wanted to go back to their hometown to open their own small bussiness after earning enough money.

> "Many readers have told us that this article has given them a deep feeling - it is not only the delivery drivers who are trapped in the system. A friend just came out of the subway station after reading this article. It was after ten o'clock in the evening and she had just got off work. She told me that at that moment, she felt that she was also a delivery driver. She was chasing KPIs every day, and it seems like not working overtime was her fault. Others say it's too breathless to read, because it's almost a narrative of their daily lives."

> “The platform outsources the delivery business to an outside company, removing any direct employment relationship with the worker. The worker purchases accident insurance, so when the worker has an accident the platform sends him to the insurance company . ” In this “buck passing” , Zheng said, “vague labor relations also make it more difficult for workers to safeguard their rights. ”

## Non-confrontational Activism

### The Other Digital China by Wang Jing

*Non-confrontational Activism*
> “The platform outsources the delivery business to an outside company, removing any direct employment relationship with the worker. The worker purchases accident insurance, so when the worker has an accident the platform sends him to the insurance company . ” In this “buck passing” , Zheng said, “vague labor relations also make it more difficult for workers to safeguard their rights. ”

> “In authoritarian countries where sensors also have double identities and move among various subject positions to negotiate their momentary allegiance, non confrontational activists stand a good chance of functioning as change agents”

> “Paradoxically, incrementalism works not just because it is the safest route but because it is the fastest way to fulfill social change in China”

- Incrementalism: (from Britannica) Policies result from a process of interaction and mutual adaptation. 

- Walking around instead of walking through obstacles. 

*NGO2.0*

> Everybody a donor “人人可公益”， “和谐社会”

- 2012 微公益 by sina.com & 腾讯月捐 -- bypass traditional donation. 
- Shadow advocacy （午餐计划）a very inactive way of engaging in activism 

## Population Planning 计划生育

### Leftover Women by Leta Hong Fincher 

> According to the state media, married women’s husbands only have affairs because their wives are too dull, and “leftover” women are only single because they are too picky. It is worth noting that none of the state media editorials warns men to be more caring husbands or their wives will start having affairs.

> Restless single men are seen as a threat to the foundation of Chinese society. And single women threaten the moral fabric as well, for being free agents, unnatural in failing to perform their duty to give birth to a child and tame a restless man. From the government’s perspective, married couples are much less likely to cause trouble.

> The State Council names the sex-ratio imbalance as one of the population pressures because it “causes a threat to social stability.” It also cites the “low quality of the general population, which makes it hard to meet the requirements of fierce competition for national strength.”

## Xinjiang

**Context**
- **Narrative** Change: "multi-cultural nation" --> war on terror
- **GWOT**: Roberts: “GWOT is not a war at all but a narrative that can serve as a **political tool** in the hands of states to advance a variety of agendas” the rhetoric of counterterrorism has been put into service as “justification for attacking domestic opponents, especially if they are Muslims” (64).
- Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps （新疆建设兵团） 
   - Sits largely outside of (or has equal power to) jurisdiction of Xinjiang Provincial Government 
   - Estimated 85-90% Han Chinese
   - 2.6 million employees
- By 2018: extensive reports of Uyghurs being sent to reeducation or internment facilities.
*Digital Enclosure*

### Terror Capitalism by Darren Tyler

- Chapter 5
   - "The Blind Wanderer" in Chinese Discourse
   -  > The "unseeing," "directionless" flow of bodies was viewed as a threat to the centrally planned communist revolution.... conveying a feeling of failure and irresponsibility 
   -  > As Guang Lei has shown, the term came to refer to a form of "circular affirmation" between urban-based government policies that sought to control the inflow of cheap labor and the xenophobic urban popular culture that sought to deny strangers a right to live in the city. 
   -  Since the mid-1990s, officials in Xinjiang and across the nation have begun to use the term farmer-worker to describe migrants rather than mangliu.
