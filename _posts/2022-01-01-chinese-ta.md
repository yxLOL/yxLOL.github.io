Hello and welcome to my... blog. I honestly still think it's just a very unorganized e-notebook, but I hope you find something helpful. Unfortunately I messed up the setting so the search function wouldn't work (I would fix it in the near future which means never). You can use the panel on the left (if you are viewing on a computer) to navigate to the tiltles more quickly. I apologize for any typos and grammar mistakes in any languages, and you are more than welcome to correct me by contacting me via email. 

[Here's a list of resources on Chinese in general, which I should be updating soon](https://yxlol.github.io/yx/resource/2022-05-12-chinese-resources.html)

[And here's a song list I doubt if I can update, since I listen to German songs almost exclusively these days](https://yxlol.github.io/yx/resources/2022-05-14-chinese-song-list.html)

Before you delve into the sea of information, I want to apologize if you find it overwhelming. I do have the habit of clustering information (so whatever I found that's relevant and worth looking at by my standard), I would put them together. So feel free to ignore whatever you are not interested in. You **don't** need these information **at all** to learn Chinese. (that's why I call it informal)

I hope you find some of them helpful. And again, feel free to request materials, because I do enjoy finding random information...

## Chinese Education

First off, I encourage you to check the [Wikipaedia page on the topic (Engilsh)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_China) and also on the [education inequality in China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_inequality_in_China).

I found this [youtube video](https://youtu.be/H6RlWqL2W8Y) which stays true to what I experienced (but in highschool, and there are details that are different...) before the pandemic.

There are tons of videos/documentaries on Chinese college entrance exam prep, and I watched... one of them. 

[The full version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WZPKZo5Yvg), but only with Chinese Subtitles.  

[The one with English subtitle but somehow 40 minutes shorter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyvHC9ryn8M) 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qyvHC9ryn8M" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

You are more than welcome to chat with me about my experience in detail (even though I didn't go through the high school part of the horror (?) Just be aware of the nature of the topic: it's not... a delightful topic. I can rant for hours...and I don't really appreciate it too much. There are people who adapt better than I did, but there's a reason I'm here at all and this is part of it.

I also have to point out that as inconsistent as China is, my experience is very different from most of them now in the country. Even compared to my peers, mine was really unique in general. I mean, you really won't expect someone who learn most of the stuff outside of school her entire life before High School even if she's Chinese (in highschool I sort of self-study everything because I have issues with staying attentive in class and I still have it very often). 

You might want to watch this [vice video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa7eZffuQps) about the cracking down of outside of school classes/课外班/补习班. It would require a general content warning but it might be less depressing than the documentary above (at least from my POV)

I also found a very interesting [article](https://web.archive.org/web/20221002230907/https://www.163.com/dy/article/HIN6B6EC0516HGOR.html) on why we have this crackdown (in Chinese). The article has been deleted on social media, but of course I found an archive. I can talk about censorship and archiving information at some point. 

Articles on Involution（内卷）！  

![A Picture of Someone Riding Bike While Programming](http://p5.itc.cn/q_70/images03/20200930/48bcc8830c45450bb4d05772c7663916.png)

Well, we really cannot discuss the topic without this context (or maybe we could? I can totally picture a bunch of Chinese I met in this school doing it... but you know me very well at this point, I won't shut up). The highly competitive nature of general education... is heavily reflected by many people, and we sort of abused this word (内卷) to the point where it no longer refers to what it means in sociology. It does describe the meaningless competition that makes everyone worths off. 

Here's an [article (in English)](https://www.readingthechinadream.com/lai-youxuan-ldquodelivery-drivers-stuck-in-the-systemrdquo.html) I read from my China Debate class. If you are considering taking that class at all (it's taught in English). You might want to read. Otherwise, it's still a very great article. I also made some notes in my notes for the class which you can navigate from the panel on the left. In case you are curious to read the Chinese text, it's [here](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/225120404)

Here's a fun piece from [What's on Weibo](https://www.whatsonweibo.com/the-concept-of-involution-neijuan-on-chinese-social-media/#:~:text=As%20explained%20by%20Jialing%20Xie,grows%2C%20per%20capita%20wealth%20decreases.) which looks at what it means on the social media (another piece of reading I shamelessly took from the China Debate).

And of course, there are numerous TV shows that are relevant. Here's [one](https://youtu.be/mTMb8e_gDzE) I can recall. (With English Subtitle on youtube).

（In Progress）

I asked my (one and almost only) Chinese friend what obscure things Chinese learners should know about, and she sent me [this article](https://chaoyangtrap.house/shaxian-cant-be-fucked-with/).

Well, it's about food, so I guess it counts.
