Hello and welcome to my... blog. I honestly still think it's just a very unorganized e-notebook, but I hope you find something helpful. Unfortunately I messed up the setting so the search function wouldn't work (I would fix it in the near future which means never). You can use the panel on the left (if you are viewing on a computer) to investigate to the tiltles more quickly. I apologize for any typos and grammar mistakes in any languages, and you are more than welcome to correct me by contacting me via email.

## Chinese Education

I found this [youtube video](https://youtu.be/H6RlWqL2W8Y) which stays true to what I experienced (but in highschool, and there are details that are different...) before the pandemic.

There are tons of videos/documentaries on Chinese college entrance exam prep, and I watched... one of them. 

[The full version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WZPKZo5Yvg), but only with Chinese Subtitles.  

[The one with English subtitle but somehow 40 minutes shorter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyvHC9ryn8M)

You are more than welcome to chat with me about my experience in detail (even though I didn't go through the high school part of it). Just be aware of the nature of the topic: these are things I talk with my therapist on a monthly basis. Don't expect it to be a delightful conversation, but I would be as sarcastic as I could (that's called coping mechanism).

And I have to also point out that as inconsistent as China is, my experience is very different from most of them now in the country. You might want to watch this [vice video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa7eZffuQps). Would require a general content warning.

Articles on InvolutionÔºÅ  

Well, we really cannot discuss the topic without this context (or maybe we could? I can totally picture a bunch of Chinese I met in this school doing it... but that's just not me). 

Here's an [article](https://www.readingthechinadream.com/lai-youxuan-ldquodelivery-drivers-stuck-in-the-systemrdquo.html) I read from my China Debate class. If you are considering taking that class at all (it's taught in English). You might want to read. Otherwise, it's till just a very great article. I also made some notes in my notes for the class which you can navigate from the panel on the left. 

Here's a fun piece from [What's on Weibo](https://www.whatsonweibo.com/the-concept-of-involution-neijuan-on-chinese-social-media/#:~:text=As%20explained%20by%20Jialing%20Xie,grows%2C%20per%20capita%20wealth%20decreases.) which looks at what it means on the social media.
