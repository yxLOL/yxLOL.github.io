## Background

- [Potofolio](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7vuttm_JKHe0qpkm4H2y2A) - In Chinese, do need google translate
- Founder of "Wuyong" (literal translation is "Useless") 無用
- She hates fashion and the title of fashion designer...
- [Statements of the brand](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA5OTgzNTYyMQ%3D%3D&mid=2649888482&idx=1&sn=3119d5860f53b54fe1d949fb1e36bba0) "我想做些眼前未必有用但以後會有價值的事，我想把人們眼中無用的東西變得有用：我想人們不再以是否有用作為取捨的原則。我喜歡『無用』，所以才能賦予它新的價值。價值從不在物件本身，而在於懂得珍惜的心。" I want to do things that don't seem to be useful now but it would be valuable in the future; I want to make useless things in people's views into useful things: I want people to make decisions not based on how useful it is. I like "useless", so that we can bring new value to it. The value is not in the material things itself, but in people who know how to cherish it.


## Design inspiration
- 兵马俑 [3]
Terracotta Warriors

- I think some of her designs were inspired by nature and natural materials (silk, in [this](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/_WLf0-1dTbW3J-h2WJs9qQ) case. There are different type of silk, and the type of silk she uses here is very special because you can only make it by hand as it's a combination between thicker and thiner silk threads which has a rough texture, and her design focuses on to illustrate the beauty of this type of material)

- My emotional world is very diversed, and I love everything in the world, I trust people I meet, and my relationship with events(I know this is vague, because it is vague)“我的情感蛮丰富，对世界万物都存有爱心，我也信赖与所遇人、事的缘分。”马可认为，本身的创作灵感也是缘于这种爱心。[2]
- 民间调研 Field Research
- Find the memory of ancestors in the households in farmers' homes, the joy of returning to nature, return to traditional culture, and traditional handcrafts(“在农民的家里找到了祖先的记忆”，“回归自然的快乐 回归传统文化，传统手工艺")
- Chinese culture is my real root of all my creations and my life. ("中國的文化是我真正的根源，我所有的創作也好，包括我個人的生命生活，最終這都是我的來源“) (This is from an interview)

how she makes her clothes

- Gather a group of tailors who come from rural China mountaineous area, use natural materials to make and dye the clothes 集结一些掌握传统女红的中国山区手工艺人，采用天然材料以手工制衣和以植物染色，把衣服从写满欲望的时装还原为体现价值的服装 (1)
- Extract plants to make clothes; some clothes were buried underground, and the erosion of rain and soil would leave traces on the cloths.“从植物中提取汁液染制成衣，一部分服装曾被埋于地下，任由雨水和泥土的侵蚀，在布料上留下斑驳的痕迹“ (4)
- She also attempted putting clothes in rivers or under the sun. 马可还尝试过把衣服长期放在河流里冲洗或在太阳下暴晒

Recent Updates
- Beijing is very close to a lockdown now, so I don't think she's doing a lot of things publicly right now. According to their wechat public account, "Due to covid, the "finding clothes--finding the most precious handmade clothes in life" exhibition is deferred.（因疫情等因素，正在展出的「尋衣——找尋生命中最珍重的手作衣裳」延期撤展，「無用尋衣」第二季開幕延後，具體時間請各位家人關注無用公眾號！）
- Not much media coverage since 2020
- Wechat Official Account for her brand shows that her company is still writing stories of clothes with special values to the owners, and [this is an example (in traditional Chinese)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/uCxHyuHHGUkbzT2jv3ZYlg) 
- Now her brand does not just sell clothes--most recently they sell "zongzi", and one of the division of her brand sells organic and vegan food

- She also holds exhibitions for folk art that are open for the public for free
- I found all of the information above on Wechat, but I think you can also find them on their official website[www.wuyong.org](http://www.wuyong.org/), which is really hard to navigate and all in traditional Chinese (nvm)
- Her most recent exhibition
