design inspiration
- 兵马俑 [3]

- My emotional world is very diversed, and I love everything in the world, I trust people I meet, and my relationship with events(I know this is vague, because it is vague)“我的情感蛮丰富，对世界万物都存有爱心，我也信赖与所遇人、事的缘分。”马可认为，本身的创作灵感也是缘于这种爱心。[2]
- 民间调研 Field Research
- Find the memory of ancestors in the households in farmers' homes, the joy of returning to nature, return to traditional culture, and traditional handcrafts(“在农民的家里找到了祖先的记忆”，“回归自然的快乐 回归传统文化，传统手工艺")
- Chinese culture is my real root of all my creations and my life. ("中國的文化是我真正的根源，我所有的創作也好，包括我個人的生命生活，最終這都是我的來源“) (I would include the source later)

how she makes her clothes

- Gather a group of tailors who come from rural China mountaineous area, use natural materials to make and dye the clothes 集结一些掌握传统女红的中国山区手工艺人，采用天然材料以手工制衣和以植物染色，把衣服从写满欲望的时装还原为体现价值的服装 (1)
- Extract plants to make clothes; some clothes were buried underground, and the erosion of rain and soil would leave traces on the cloths.“从植物中提取汁液染制成衣，一部分服装曾被埋于地下，任由雨水和泥土的侵蚀，在布料上留下斑驳的痕迹“ (4)
- She also attempted putting clothes in rivers or under the sun. 马可还尝试过把衣服长期放在河流里冲洗或在太阳下暴晒
- [Some Clips of Making Clothes (this one is making the cloth from threads)](https://youtu.be/QiUksdPiXcQ?t=1501)

and what she’s been up to
- Not much media coverage since 2020
- Wechat Official Account for her brand shows that she's still making documentaries of stories of clothes 
- Now her brand does not just sell clothes--most recently they sell "zongzi", and one of the division of her brand sells organic and vegan food 
![zongzi](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Zongzi.jpg)
- She also holds exhibitions for folk art that are open for the public for free
- I found all of the information above on Wechat, but I think you can also find them on their official website[www.wuyong.org](http://www.wuyong.org/), which is really hard to navigate and all in traditional Chinese (nvm)


- 第一夫人的设计师: She was the courlier for China's first lady, Peng Liyuan/Xi Jinping's wife), and she "hopes that she can show the world the design idea centered on Chinese culture ("希望透过第一夫人的影响力，向世界展示以中华文化为核心精神的服装设计理念。"[1]
