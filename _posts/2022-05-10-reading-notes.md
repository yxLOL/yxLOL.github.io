**Quotes and Comments**

> An infinitely smaller problem, but one that occupied infinitely more of my energy, was that transition sentence. Chinese education traditionally emphasizes imitation of models and rote literary phrases, and my Fuling students diligently incorporated the transition into their argumentative papers. It infected other writing, too: personal narratives, dialogues, literary essays. I might be reading a paper about “Hamlet,” when suddenly a voice would boom out, worse than Polonius’s: “But we should not give up eating for fear of choking.” The words are a direct translation of yinyefeishi, a Chinese literary phrase. Over and over, I tried to explain that this sounds terrible in English.

- "The transition sentence" (过渡句) was something I had to use as a part of the essay writing in Chinese all the time and I suspect the students mentioned adapt it into English. However I'm curious how that counts as "transition sentence" because it looks like a comment at the end of the analysis, or maybe they use it as a new point... In general 成语 is not the best thing to use in an essay I'd say. I'm also wondering whether "因噎废食" (give up eating for fear of choking) is part of the 中庸之道 (staying in the middle)  
*totally shifted the focus away but... I'm confused*

> For a returning teacher, this was a mystery: how had China experienced so much social, economic, and educational change while the politics remained stagnant, or even regressive? Nobody in freshman English was going to argue that it was a bad idea to remove Presidential term limits, or that the internment camps in Xinjiang should be abolished. Even if a student took a pro-government stance on a sensitive topic, he couldn’t fully engage with a counter-argument. And there was some risk for a teacher who played devil’s advocate while editing.

- the answer, according to the latter part of the article, is that they are busy competing each other (involution/内卷) instead of exercising citizen's rights to be against dictatorship...
- Also I think the fact that this generation (well, my generation) grows up in the patriortic/nationalistic education makes it incredibly hard to see the "alternatives".

> I hadn’t thought it was possible to make “1984” any darker, but the students had succeeded.

- My favourite quote from the article. This also leads me wondering how people can separate between the literary work and the real life they are experiencing, since the students do appear to be very competent in understanding the flaws of the "system", but maybe just as he mentioned in the article, they recoganize the "drawbacks" but they also don't support 因噎废食 (yin ye fei shi)

> But my students at Sichuan University were old souls. They knew how things worked; they understood the system’s flaws and also its benefits. The environment they were entering was essentially the same one in which their parents had worked: for the first time, China has been both stable and prosperous for a period that’s longer than a university student’s memory.

- In Chinese we have a very harsh term to comment on people of this kind (精致的利己主义者 delicate egoist, it's harsh in a collectivism context). 
- It also explains why those students don't find any problems with the ruling government -- they are the beneficiaries and they don't have any incentive to change the system. 

> I think my generation, born in the age of the Internet, is puzzled and somehow depressed by the conflict between Chinese beliefs and Western ones. Propaganda about liberty and reason prevails on the Internet while propaganda about patriotism and Communism prevails in the textbooks. Youngsters are mostly attracted by the former, but when passing exams and pursuing jobs, they should bear in mind the latter, and in practice in China, more often than not, the latter functions better.

- Interesting perception by bringing the Western's POV. For me I'm more confused by the contradictory stances people take at the same time. To better capture my feeling I would use the term 撕裂感 (the sense of tearing?). 
- Put into the context, I think it manifests how it's just easier and more practical not to go against the current. 

> The Little Pink phenomenon, which seems to be amplified by social media, was not something I observed in the classroom. In my experience, the Chinese students of twenty-five years ago were much more nationalistic, and much less aware, than the students of today.

- Very interesting observations ~~and I should let all my internet friends read this paragraph~~. I think a part of it is also the different social-economic status his students were in compared to the students he taught in Sichuan University. Students here are just being very shrewd in choosing what works the best for them. 

> It impressed me as another way in which the system functioned effectively: in the hybrid arrangement, the decision to get rid of the American teacher could be blamed on the American institution.

- How did he confirm this though. Also there's not a lot of details about it. I guess it is always hard...

> When teaching Orwell, I often thought about why such books aren’t considered a threat to the Party. In the novels of the Dystopian Trilogy, futuristic societies distract and control individuals by various methods: the continuous war and rewritten history of “1984,” the sex and soma drugs of “Brave New World,” the surgical removal of human imagination in “We.” **But none of these books anticipates how useful competition can be in sustaining a long-term authoritarian state.** In China, nationalistic propaganda might be effective for children and other people at a lower level, but there’s a tacit understanding that it won’t work as well for the highly educated. As long as these individuals have opportunities to advance and improve their lives, they are less likely to oppose authority. And the system doesn’t need to be hermetically sealed in the manner of “1984.” The vast majority of Chinese students who go abroad choose to return—for them, it’s as simple as yinyefeishi. If they were truly afraid of choking, they would remain in the United States.

- The unexpected effect of involution. 

> And there’s a point at which competition becomes a highly effective distraction. For most of my students, the greatest worry didn’t seem to be classroom security cameras or other instruments of state control—it was the thought of all those talented young people around them.

> Holiday means others went out to play and I am studying, which is the time that I have the highest relative efficiency. I could learn more than others and I will get a higher GPA. Holiday is the best time that I can go surpass my classmates in study.

> The week before I left the university, I met off campus with the publication’s staff. There were about twenty students, almost all of them female. That was another aspect of university life that wasn’t quite Orwellian. From “1984”: “**It was always the women, and above all the young ones, who were the most bigoted adherents of the Party, the swallowers of slogans, the amateur spies and nosers-out of unorthodoxy.**” In my experience, female students seemed less nationalistic than the men, and I suspected they were less likely to jubao a professor.


## Why Xinjiang is an internal settler colony
by Darren Byler, Sept.1, 2021

**Quotes and Comments**

- Context
   > These new trees, planted in the 1990s and 2000s, were the “Open Up the Northwest” (西北大开发 xīběi dà kāifā) and “Open Up the West” trees (西部大开发 xībù dà kāifā). The people I interviewed also called them “investment” (Uy: kapital) trees. In many cases, the work brigades, which are still the most common form of rural government in Xinjiang, sold the rights to these young trees to villagers. At a certain point, decades from now, they will be permitted to cut down the trees and enjoy the profits of their lumber.

   > In the early 2000s, the Hú Jǐntāo 胡锦涛 administration took the regional project “Open Up the Northwest” to a new level, rebranding it as “Open Up the West.”

   > The “Open Up the Northwest” project had resulted in rapid and sustained economic growth of over 10 percent per year since 1992, so state authorities were eager to take the development projects further, opening new markets and new sites for industrial production. By the early 2000s, the Uyghur homeland had become the country’s fourth largest oil-producing area, with a capacity of 20 million tons per year.

   - I (for whatever reason that is) never had a second thought about the "Open up the West" policies. Very important context to add I'd say. 


- Cotton:   
   > At the same time, in June 1992 Chinese leaders announced a new policy position that would turn the Uyghur homeland into a center of trade, capitalist infrastructure, and agricultural development capable of further serving the needs of the national economy. One of the main emphases in the new proposal was the need to establish Xinjiang as one of China’s primary cotton-producing regions.

   > By 2020, 85 percent of Chinese cotton was produced in the Uyghur region.

   > Using threats of land seizures and detention — a type of legalized theft or expropriation — local authorities often forced farmers to convert their existing multi-crop farms to cotton in order to meet buyer-imposed quotas. In the same manner, in their capacity as brokers with state enterprise buyers, local officials forced farmers to sell their cotton only to these buyers. These corporations in turn sold the cotton at full market price to factories in Eastern China.

- Colony
   > For Tohti, the most important factors associated with Uyghur dispossession were “blatant ethnic discrimination in hiring, a rural labor surplus, overconcentration of economic resources in Han Chinese-dominated urban areas, ‘stability maintenance policies’ that restrict population mobility and exacerbate rural unemployment, and severe underinvestment in basic education.” Millward argues that “what Tohti described — without using the word — is a colonial system of settlement and extraction in Xinjiang.”

   - I do want to add here why we wouldn't find analyzing Chinese investment in Africa from the colonialism pov productive--the details do matter. 

   > This process has been fostered by state capital, which subsidized the development of natural resource and industrial agriculture sectors by injecting billions of yuan into the region. As the sociologist Ching Kwan Lee has shown, Chinese state capital often acts as a subsidy in securing long-term economic interests even if they are not immediately profitable. By investing in the Han settlement of Xinjiang, putting settlers to work in natural resource extraction and overseer positions on industrial farming plantations, and fostering a service sector that supported this development, the state was assured of a permanent reserve of domestic energy and raw materials essential to economic growth.

   - So basically extracting the region's resources without benefiting the residents at all... 

   > In 2014, Uyghur protests against these obvious forms of west-east wealth transfer were officially outlawed as one of 75 signs of religious extremism or violent terrorism.

   > In Xinjiang, dispossession is not just about a lack of compensation, it is about a process of illegalizing traditions and turning sacred land into property.

   > These three elements — material dispossession, institutional domination, and settler occupation — are what established Xinjiang as a contemporary settler colony that was internal to the Chinese state.

## 郑杭生：民族团结与和谐社会建设——一种社会学的解读

*The link to the article is [here](http://www.aisixiang.com/data/31745.html). It was written in 2010, so after the 7.5 event in 2009. I think it is a good reference to the central gov's attitude towards "民族大团结" as a narrative at that time, even though it does have a long history. Basically, the "multicultrualism" with Chinese characteristics means that we all fight and build the "socialism" together.*

*就中国的情况说，“民族团结”，就是把我国56个不同民族联合起来，使之成为彼此具有相互依存的良性互动关系、并形成**更大民族共同体--中华民族**的过程和状态。*

*广泛的民族认同*
- *第一个层次，即高一级层次的民族认同，就是**对中华民族的认同**。*
- *第二个层次，即基层的民族认同，就是对56个民族**各自社会身份和社会角色的认同***
- *多元一体格局中，56个民族是基层，**中华民族是高层***
- *在当代中国，民族认同并不是单纯民族认同的问题，而是**与祖国认同、中华文化认同、中国特色社会主义道路认同，紧密联系在一起**的。*

*我们要建立的社会主义民族关系，是“平等、团结、互助、和谐”的**新型民族关系***
- *和谐社会的建设，包含有双重的任务、解决两个方面的问题，第一，就是如何在一个市场经济的陌生人世界里构筑人际关系和谐、互助合作的新的社会共同体，这个社会共同体，在宏观上叫做和谐社会，在微观上叫做和谐社区*
- *第二，就是如何在价值观开放多元的环境中构建认同度高、归属感强的意义共同性，这种意义共同性，在宏观上叫做社会归属感，在微观上叫做社区归属感，对各个民族来说就是民族归属感*


*在实际的社会生活中，民族团结还表现为：努力消除一切不利于民族团结的因素，既反对大民族主义，主要是大汉族主义，也反对地方民族主义，坚定不移地维护民族团结。*

*第二，民族团结本身就是社会和谐不可或缺的重要内容*

*国际敌对势力对我国实行西化和分化的政治图谋一刻也没有放松，与国内民族分裂势力相互勾结，处心积虑地利用所谓“民族”、“宗教”、“人权”等问题，加紧对我进行渗透、分裂、破坏和颠覆活动。民族问题的特点是，它涉及国家的核心利益，一出现就不是小问题。*

- For me I think most words use a different definition here compared to their western origins. 

*第三，民族团结对社会和谐的重要性越来越突出*

*对此，我们必须站在国家统一、民族团结这一最高利益、核心利益的高度，采取特殊政策措施，下大力气解决：在发展战略和总体布局中，把加快少数民族和民族聚居地区发展，摆到更加突出、更加重要、更加紧迫的位置上来。既要投入更多的资金，又要给予更优惠的政策;既要帮助他们把经济搞上去，又要帮助他们发展各项社会事业;既要继续发挥中央政府的作用，又要坚持抓好各地的对口支持工作。切实加大感情投入、政策投入、人才投入、资金投入和科技投入。充分调动民族聚居地区内外两个积极性，使民族聚居地区的发展实现新的跨越。*

## New Regulations on Algorithms

**One month after the implementation of new regulations on algorithms, how many personalized recommendation services still intrude on personal information?**

Link to translation is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CCqTuyNwKzCDCPygQ8LGu3PrHQ2dZXdV4bf_-3catVY/edit#), and the original article is [here](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/TfaeivjJQ65sW3LAWLzx5Q?). I found it on [ChinaAI Newsletter](https://chinai.substack.com/)

> Since the implementation of the regulations, here’s what some companies have done:
> - WeChat, Meituan, Bilibili, Douyin, Taobao, Weibo, and Toutiao have added buttons for users to **turn off personalized recommendation functions**.
> - Some apps now let users **view the specific personal info collected by the app as well as the frequency of collection**. A few provide an option for users to clear previous activities on the app with one click.
> - The regulations also require companies to **increase transparency about how their recommendation algorithms work**. Meituan, one of the companies called out by that People exposé on food deliveries, now provides **more information about how they calculate “estimated arrival time” for deliveries and builds in more time for delivery workers.**
