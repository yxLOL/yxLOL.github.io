Songs I enjoy a lot. Some in Cantonese some in Chinese. Introduction to be followed.

Incase you are interested in how I feel every once in a while reading all the news.

This one surely has a lot of allusions, which prevent the songwriter from having any works available in mainland China. Not necessarily my favorite song but surely an interesting work.

Related to 1989 Tian'anmen square mascare, which also effectively makes them banned in China. I do think they are trying to explore the "oriental" style in the track, but I'm not that familiar with music genres in general.

This one is about HK... I do like the structure of the song lol

A little on the context: in the news report of sexual violence and crime victims, "小娟" is widely use as a seudo-name. While this act is to protect the family's feelings, the frequency of this name is shockingly high, and slut-shaming is still very wide-spread. 

I would include the full album here, because I like all of them.
