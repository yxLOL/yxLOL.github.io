Chinese Songs I enjoy a lot. Some in Cantonese some in mandarin. Introduction to be followed. Keep in mind that I don't listen to Chinese songs very often, so... I'm really not the best people to make recommendations music-wise. I do find listening to the language you want to learn very helpful though. 

I hope you enjoy some of them.

In case you are interested in how I feel every once in a while reading all the news about the country I come from. Just kidding. It refers to a tragic event of [bombings in Shijiazhuang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shijiazhuang_bombings) on March 16, 2001. The mood in the song also responds to the sense of disillusion in the North East region of China after privatization of state-owned enterprises (as part of market reform started in 1970s), which resulted in stagnation in the area which they still haven't escaped from today. (In mandarin)

This one surely has a lot of satirical political references, which prevent the songwriter from having any works available in mainland China. Not necessarily my favorite song but surely an interesting work. (In mandarin, but probably Malaysian Chinese, and I can't really tell much differences)

Related to 1989 Tian'anmen square mascare, which effectively makes them banned in China. I do think they are trying to explore the "oriental" style in the track, but I'm not that familiar with music genres in general. (In Cantonese)

This one is about HK... I do like the structure of the song as a math nerd lol (in Cantonese)

Isabelle Huang certainly has a special talent. I think this song follows this very popular genre of retro classic (古风). Usually I don't like it, but this one might be an exception. The opening lines are form a famous poem 静夜思, which expresses nostalgia. (In mandarin)

A little on the context: in the news report of sexual violence and crime victims, "小娟" is widely use as a seudo-name. While this act is to protect the family's feelings, the frequency of this name is shockingly high, and slut-shaming is still very wide-spread. 

I would include the full album here, because I like all of them. (besides one in Taiwanese, all the others are in mandarin)

I realize maybe I should include more upbeat songs as well. I promise I don't have mental health problems...ok I do. I really like this one though. The recurring lyrics in the bridge is very interesting：

> 命運就算顛沛流離 命運就算曲折離奇  
命運就算恐嚇著你做人沒趣味  
別流淚 心酸 更不應捨棄  
我願能 一生永遠陪伴你  

which translates as 

> Even if fate is upside down, even if fate is twisted and bizarre  
> Even if fate threatens you, that it's not fun to be a human being  
> Don't cry, [or] be sad, and don't give up  
> I wish to be with you forever

which does not really make sense now, but that was the mood in the 1990s HK, if anything.  (in Cantonese)

Beyond is a very famous band (from HK) in China. This song was written as a tribute to Nelson Mandela. (in Cantonese)

Alright I know I have a weird taste of music, and I do realize I don't have many songs in mandarin to recommend... Sorry, but not really, because trust me I tried.

P.S I swear I recommend them not because they are banned (some of them aren't...) I have no idea how this happened. I swear. I swear.
