Songs I enjoy a lot. Some in Cantonese some in Chinese. Introduction to be followed.

This one surely has a lot of allusions, which prevent the songwriter from having any works available in mainland China. Not necessarily my favorite song but surely an interesting work.

Related to 1989 Tian'anmen square mascare, which also effectively makes them banned in China. I do think they are trying to explore the "oriental" style in the track, but I'm not that familiar with music genres in general.

This one is about HK... I do like the structure of the song lol

Alright I know I have a weird taste of music.
